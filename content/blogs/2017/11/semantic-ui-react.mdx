If you think Bootstrap is great for building user interfaces, well, Semantic UI takes brilliance to a whole new level.
For React developers, there's a fantastic library available that offers a set of Semantic UI components ready to use. I
recently decided to give it a try and replace the existing Bootstrap-based template. The result? A codebase that's
cleaner, more concise, and the whole migration cost me just one line of CSS. Intrigued already?

While the library is still in a pre-1.0 version (currently at 0.79 as of writing), it offers a remarkable 100% coverage
of components from the original [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/). You can explore the library and its features
[here](https://semantic-ui.com/).
