# Introduction

Hangfire simplifies performing fire-and-forget, delayed, and recurring tasks within ASP.NET applications. It eliminates
the need for Windows Services or separate processes and is backed by persistent storage. Best of all, it's open and free
for commercial use.

## Use Cases

There are a number of use cases when you need to perform background processing in a web application:

- mass notifications/newsletter
- batch import from xml, csv, json
- creation of archives
- firing off web hooks
- deleting users
- building different graphs
- image/video processing
- purge temporary files
- recurring automated reports
- database maintenance

and counting..

In this post, we are about to create new ASP.NET Core MVC application, with configured database, then install and
configure Hangfire to run in the background for us. So let`s get started!

# Setup PostgreSQL database

There are more than one way to setup PostgreSQL database. I’m about to use Docker for the purpose, but you can install
it directly from the [Postgresql official website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

If you choose do download and install PostgreSQL, skip the following Docker commands. Instead configure you db instance
with the parameters from the Docker example.  
Otherwise we need Docker installed and running. Lets proceed with pulling the image for PostgreSQL. Open terminal and
run:  
`$ docker pull postgresql`

Once we have the image, let's create a container from it and provide username and password for the database:  
`$ docker run -d -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres`

After this our database should be up and running.

# Create ASP.NET Core MVC project

Let`s create new MVC project and configure it to use our database.

Create new folder and enter it:  
`$ mkdir aspnet-psql-hangfire && cd aspnet-psql-hangfire`

When creating new project, you can go with whatever you want from the list of available dotnet project templates. I'll
stick to MVC.  
`$ dotnet new mvc`

Next install Nuget package for PostgreSQL Entity Framework driver:  
`$ dotnet add package Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL`

Add empty dbcontext:

```
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

namespace aspnet_psql_hangfire.Models
{
    public class DefaultDbContext : DbContext
    {
        public DefaultDbContext(DbContextOptions<DefaultDbContext> options)
            : base(options) { }
    }
}
```

Restore the packages by running:  
`$ dotnet restore`

Edit `appsettings.json` and enter the connection string:

```
{
    "connectionStrings": {
        "defaultConnection":
            "Host=localhost;
			Port=5433;
			Username=postgres;
			Password=postgres;
			Database=aspnet-psql-hangfire-db"
    },
	"Logging": {
		"LogLevel": {
			"Default": "Warning"
		}
	},
	"AllowedHosts": "*"
}
```

The framework must know that we want to use PostgreSQL database so add the driver to your `Startup.cs` file within the
ConfigureServices method:

```
services.AddEntityFrameworkNpgsql().AddDbContext<DefaultDbContext>(options => {
    options.UseNpgsql(Configuration.GetConnectionString("defaultConnection"));
});
```

We are ready for a initial migration:  
`$ dotnet ef migrations add InitContext && dotnet ef database update`

# Install Hangfire

Let’s continue with final steps — install packages for Hangfire:  
`$ dotnet add package Hangfire.AspNetCore && dotnet add package Hangfire.Postgresql`

Add the following using statement to the `Startup.cs`:

```
using Hangfire;
using Hangfire.PostgreSql;
```

Again in the ConfigureServices method in the `Startup.cs`, let Hangfire server to use our default connection string:

```
services.AddHangfire(x =>
    x.UsePostgreSqlStorage(Configuration.GetConnectionString("defaultConnection")));
```

Again in `Startup.cs`, but now in Configure method enter:

```
app.UseHangfireDashboard(); //Will be available under http://localhost:5000/hangfire"
app.UseHangfireServer();
```

Then restore again the packages by typing:  
`$ dotnet restore`

## Create tasks

In the Configure method, below the `app.UseHangFireServier()` add the following tasks:

```
//Fire-and-Forget
BackgroundJob.Enqueue(() => Console.WriteLine("Fire-and-forget"));

//Delayed
BackgroundJob.Schedule(() => Console.WriteLine("Delayed"), TimeSpan.FromDays(1));

//Recurring
RecurringJob.AddOrUpdate(() => Console.WriteLine("Minutely Job"), Cron.Minutely);

//Continuation
var id = BackgroundJob.Enqueue(() => Console.WriteLine("Hello, "));
BackgroundJob.ContinueWith(id, () => Console.WriteLine("world!"));
```

And finally run the app:  
`$ dotnet run`

Observe tasks logging to the console:

<GatsbyImage image={props.embedded.image1} alt="Hangfire tasks being executed" />

Now go to the dashboard provided by Hangfire at **http://localhost:5000/hangfire** for more task info.

<GatsbyImage image={props.embedded.image2} alt="Hangfire dashboard" />

# Summary

Keep in mind that the dashboard is only available for localhost connections. If you would like to use it in production,
you have to apply authentication methods. There are plenty of tutorials describing how to do that.

Here is the [repo](https://github.com/gmarokov/aspnet-psql-hangfire) from the project, I hope you liked it. Happy
coding!
