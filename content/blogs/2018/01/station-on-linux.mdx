In today's fast-paced digital world, our reliance on web applications for daily tasks is more significant than ever. How
do you typically manage this ever-expanding web app landscape? Obviously, using bookmarks or manually typing URLs. Well,
what if I told you there's an application that can streamline this process and serve as your one-stop hub for all things
web-app-related? It's called Station, and while it's been around for a while, the recent release of Station shows
commitment.

The primary concept behind Station is to group all your web apps into a single, easily accessible location, accessible
with just one click. With over 100 apps already integrated and more constantly being added, Station is on a mission to
transform how you work.

Quick note that a few months ago, I've requested one my frequently used app to be added as integrated apps, and to my
surprise, they did in pretty short time.

You should check the app at (https://getstation.com/)[https://getstation.com/].
