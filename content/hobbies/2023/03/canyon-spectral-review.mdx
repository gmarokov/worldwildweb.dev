_Canyon Spectral 29 CF7 160/150 mm (front/rear) 14.64 kg (size L) € 3,199  
[Manufacturer-website](https://www.canyon.com)_

# Introduction

You can get pretty overwhelmed by all the types of bikes and categories of MTB if you are a beginner - XC, down-country,
trail, all-mountain, enduro, DH. This can happen with experienced rider as well (seen that).  
All these types of bikes have one thing in common - the mountain. In the mountain there are rocks, roots, sand, mud,
rain, snow and sweat. Choosing a bike for your desired category might scope the task a bit, but what if you want to ride
it...all?  
You can always have n+1 bikes, of course, but this comes with not a small maintenance cost.

Isn’t there a bike to rule them all? Maybe it is. Many of the latest all-mountain bikes assert this capability. This
should be the blend between a trail bike capable of going strong uphill and an enduro bike which float in it`s own
waters during the downhill.

So I was after a Jack of all trades, master of none bike to match my skills. Quickly forward after a year and a half of
owning a Canyon Spectral CF7, I'll try to share my honest long term review.

# About the bike

For 2021, the carbon frame of the Spectral 29 has been redeveloped from scratch. Apart from the name and the Horst-link
suspension, Canyon’s 29" trail bike has very little in common with its predecessor.  
The Spectral CF 7 falls on the long-travel side of the "trail bike" category. With a 160 mm fork and 150 mm rear
suspension, the Spectral certainly blurs mountain biking lines between trail and enduro bikes.  
The full carbon frame rolls on 29-inch wheels and boasts modern geometry. A slack 64-degree head-tube angle is paired
with a moderate 76.5-degree seat-tube angle.

## The frame

  </div>
</div>

The **paintjob** of those bikes is amazing. In the case of my owned Spectral, it’s gloss black in the front and matte
black at the back.

**Invisiframe** can equip the bike with additionally **foil protection** which comes in the same finish as the frame
color. I was impressed.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">

    <p class="px-3">
      <i>
        The Spectral uses a <strong>Horst link rear suspension</strong> layout with a horizontally mounted shock.
        Despite the shock layout, there is room for a <strong>600ml water bottle</strong> inside the front triangle, but
        any bigger than that and you'll start running into clearance issues.{' '}
      </i>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <GatsbyImage alt="rear-axle" image={props.embedded.image14} />
    <p class="px-3">
      <i>
        The <strong>rear axle</strong> has a lever that slides out for wheel removal, then tucks away when not in use.
      </i>
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

**Cables and the rear brake** hose are internally routed through the downtube and chain stays. Its really quite even on
the roughest trails and provides that clean looks. Indeed I do get sometimes small amount of debris in the frame from
the cable route. This happens likely because of the fact that I transport my bike upside down.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">

    <p class="px-3">
      <i>I managed to solve this problem by placing a cut sponge between the front triangle and the rear.</i>

Other details include a <strong>threaded bottom bracket</strong>, and molded chainstay, seatstay, and <strong>downtube
protection. </strong>  
The chainstay protector started to rip off after a few months, which required additional glue and duck tape to be easily
fixed.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">

  </div>
  <div>
    <GatsbyImage alt="chain-protection" image={props.embedded.image10} />
  </div>
</div>

An **integrated upper guide** adds a little extra security against dropped chains, and while there aren't any ISCG tabs
to be seen Canyon does offer a removable mount that can be purchased separately.

<GatsbyImage alt="chain-guide" image={props.embedded.image11} />

The frame allows carrying **bag storage**. An additional propertiery bag from Canyon which surprised me with it’s
capacity. It’s not fully integrated into the frame like Trek or Specialized for example. Nice feature, but in my opinion
comes a bit pricy at €35.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  <div>
    <GatsbyImage alt="bag-on-pike" image={props.embedded.image12} />

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  <div>
    <GatsbyImage alt="flip-chip" image={props.embedded.image9} />
  </div>
  <div>
    <strong>A flip chip</strong> in the shock mount allows you to change the head and seat tube angle by 0.5° and the
    bottom bracket height by 8 mm. Slacker head angle drops to 64° in the low setting and the seat tube angle to 70°.
  </div>
</div>

**Pivot bolts** are not directly mounting to the frame instead aluminum inserts are used. And they are all places on the
left of the frame for easy maintenance.

The spectral also comes with **UDH** which is always welcomed.

## The components

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  <div>
    <GatsbyImage alt="fork" image={props.embedded.image15} />
    <p class="px-3">
      <i>
        Forgiveness of the suspension is nicely handled by <strong>Fox Rhythm 36 Fit Grip</strong>. It has low speed
        rebound and 2-position compression settings. Comes preloaded with 3 tokens.

    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <GatsbyImage alt="shock" image={props.embedded.image16} />
    <p class="px-3">
      <i>
        On the back we have <strong>Fox Float X Performance</strong> with low speed rebound setting as well as
        2-position compression lever. I ended up removing one of the 2 available tokens.
      </i>
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

The **12 speed Shimano SLX drivetrain** feels really well by providing smooth shifting.

<GatsbyImage alt="drivetrain" image={props.embedded.image17} />

**Braking** is reassured by 4 pistons Shimano SLX M7120 and Hayes rotors but most of the Shimano users know of their
inconsistency at least on the rear. The brake requires periodical rebleeding to keep running correctly otherwise it
might start to feel squishy and doesn’t bite where you expect it.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  <GatsbyImage alt="brake-lever" image={props.embedded.image18} />
  <GatsbyImage alt="brake" image={props.embedded.image19} />
</div>

The **DT Swiss rims** came with 30mm of inner width, Ratchet hub and straightpull spokes. They are really light and
tubeless ready (tape applied). I also fitter a rim protector at the back but that didn’t help to slightly bend the rear
rim. A few spokes came loose and broke during rides which wasn’t the nicest experience as well.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  <GatsbyImage alt="rim" image={props.embedded.image20} />
  <GatsbyImage alt="rim-bent" image={props.embedded.image21} />
</div>

Comfort is reassured by the **170 mm dropper post** from Canyon. Due to the long seatstay only 180mm of travel can be
inserted into the frame of size L.

**_Ergon enduro comp saddle_** feels good on my bottoms, but it was starting to rip off after a few months. Canyon
kindly send replacement immediately after reported.

<GatsbyImage alt="saddle" image={props.embedded.image22} />

G5 cockpit (**handlebar, stem, spacers, grips**) was also completely designed to provide tidy look and good ergonomics
which is in-house built by Canyon. In combination with the Shimano I-SPEC components, the cockpit of the Spectral
ensures good and clean looks.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  <GatsbyImage alt="cockpit" image={props.embedded.image23} />
  <GatsbyImage alt="cockpit-second" image={props.embedded.image24} />
</div>

**The headset** is covered by a plastic cap which matches exactly with the G5 spacers and stem. This fact limits the
customization option. One well known Spectral issue is the creaking headset after a few months of usage. New cap from
Cane Creak ZS49 - part: BAA0078K resolves the issue but this also requires to upgrade the stem and the spacers. In my
case, a good cleaning and a huge amount of grease once in a while did the trick.

**Tires** are a spot on with **Maxxis DHR2 MaxxGrip** at the front and **MaxTerra Exo+** at the back. Unfortunately they
didn’t last long so I happily replaced them with Continental Kryptotal. Feels more draggy, but what a grip and endurance
these tires have!

For **pedals** I choose Crank Brothers Stamp 1 L, which disappointed with lack of grip, but quickly fixed with new
longer bolts.

# My ride experience

If I’m being honest, my first few rides on the bike were not ideal. Like many things in mountain biking, getting used to
a new bike is a process, and I found my process took longer than expected.

The major issue I had was a general out-of-control feeling while descending at high speeds. As soon as I hit any chunky
or chattery bits, the Spectral felt as if it was going to skip out from underneath me. I diagnosed this problem as
having less to do with the Spectral itself and more to do with how I set up the suspension. Rather than feeling
supported, I felt bounced around by the suspension. More than a few settings attempts later and a few tokens removed, I
think I’ve managed to dial it.

When opening it up on the Spectral and riding fast on rough trails, I found it **pretty important to ride with an
aggressive, forward stance** and this is especially true in corners as the front wheel can pretty easily wash out
without proper weight on it.

On the other hand, without proper technique, **it might feel big into tight corners** due it’s longer wheelbase.

## Climbing

**A distinct lack of squat** from pedaling input made the bike climb with a sense of urgency and good amount of support
for traction where needed.

The bike`s modern geometry helps a lot, especially the seat tube angle, which is a moderately steep 76.5 on the
Spectral.  
This puts the rider more forward on the bike and over the bottom bracket, allowing for more efficient pedaling.

I also prefer the high setting of the flip chip mostly to avoid pedal strikes. Maybe shorter cranks would improve this a
bit.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  <GatsbyImage alt="climbing-1" image={props.embedded.image28} />
  <GatsbyImage alt="climbing-2" image={props.embedded.image27} />
</div>

## Descending

On the way down, it feels like you have more than enough room to move around the Spectral and change your body position
for what the trail had coming.

Geometry inspires confidence and doesn’t push you to the back when things get steeper.  
I feel weight more forward, dropping my chest, and trusting the bike’s long wheelbase.

Once dialed and used to, the bike becomes well grounded, humble and more capable to go fast. Its not scared of going air
too and the suspension doing it`s best to support you where needed.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  <GatsbyImage alt="climbing-1" image={props.embedded.image29} />
  <GatsbyImage alt="climbing-2" image={props.embedded.image30} />
</div>

<p></p>

# Overall

## Pros

- High quality build and finish
- Excellent value for money
- Excellent all-round qualities is what I was after and this bike got them
- Pedal-neutral suspension ensures good climbing qualities
- Inspires confidence during the descends for it`s longer and slacker geometry
- Excellent customer support from Canyon

## Cons

- Headset creek mentioned above
- It feels a bit large for some tidy trails. The old school shorter bike would benefit in such segments. Already
  sacrificed a derailer in the trail gods name.
- Since I transport my bike upside down, there are some strange times where debris enter the frame from the opened space
  for the internal cable routing between the front and the back triangles. Fixed with sponge insert :D (probably con
  only for me)
- In the Spectral group you can see a lot of bikes having problems with the bottom bracket shell which is production
  defect in the 2021-22 Spectrals. It’s still covered by warranty though.

The Canyon Spectral 29 CF7 is the ultimate do-it-all weapon and a perfect all-rounder for (almost) any type of rider!  
**The bike feels capable**, but it’s not a full-on Enduro bike, either. It’s got moderately progressive suspension and
feels more precise than ultra-forgiving and plush. It’s a bike that maintains speed really well as long as you don’t
force it to eat every hole, rock, and compression the trail puts in front of you. The Spectral 29 rewards an engaged
rider who rides at 90% pace most of the time. It feels like a better choice for someone who is generally in control and
on top of line choice than it is for less experienced, more timid riders.

**Who’s it for?**

I believe the Spectral could work for a very wide range of mountain bikers.

1. Riders looking for a do-it-all, versatile Trail bike with a bias toward downhill performance
2. Riders looking for a lightweight long-travel Trail bike with a lot of value
3. Riders looking for a more nimble bike, rather than a very planted one

Hope this article helps you make the right decision. Enjoy the ride!
