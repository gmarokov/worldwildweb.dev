from the "Developer-Theme" template created by Xiaoying Riley, accessible at

serves as a foundation for my blog.

# Key highlights

- Developed using PHP, WordPress, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and CSS technologies.
- Designed with a user-centric approach, focusing on the needs of individual bloggers and content creators.
- Publicly available for exploration and use at the following repository:
  [MVP WordPress Theme Repository](https://github.com/gmarokov/mvp-theme).

# Project impact

The MVP WordPress Theme offers bloggers and content creators a user-friendly and customizable solution for sharing their

preferences, making it an accessible choice for personal blogging endeavors.
